This gallery showcases shaded relief graphics I've created. Everything shown here was created using the [{rayshader}](https://www.rayshader.com/) R package created by [Tyler Morgan-Wall](https://twitter.com/tylermorganwall). My original inspiration for these came from graphics created by Twitter user [@researchremora](https://twitter.com/researchremora), who also shared some tips that were greatly helpful as I was learning. Many of the colors come from the [{MetBrewer}](https://github.com/BlakeRMills/MetBrewer) package (created by [Blake Mills](https://twitter.com/BlakeRobMills)) and the [{scico}](https://github.com/thomasp85/scico) R package that provides access to scientific color palettes created by [Fabio Crameri](https://twitter.com/fcrameri). Sometimes I source data by searching the internet, but often I use the [{elevatr}](https://github.com/jhollist/elevatr/) package created by [Jeff Hollister](https://twitter.com/jhollist). Finally, I wrote a tutorial post about how I go about creating these graphics, which you can find [here](https://spencerschien.info/post/data_viz_how_to/high_quality_rayshader_visuals/).
