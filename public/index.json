The Prompt Please present a recommendation based on your work on the following case study. We will be looking for your:\n Analytical skills when not all data is available and certain Ability to distill the analysis to an accessible recommendation  All numbers in the case study are fabricated.\nShocjin Nonprofit receives significant private funding through various channels including private individuals, foundations, and corporations. Historically, Shocjin Nonprofit has prioritized corporate partnerships and foundations whom often provide multi-year grants in significant amounts over individuals, who often give in one-off donations of small quantities. In the most recent year, however, with the introduction of the ‚ÄúGiving Society‚Äù some sites in the Shocjin Nonprofit network have doubled down on a strategy which more heavily emphasizes private individuals. The tradeoff is that this investment requires having at least one development staff member exclusively work on the Giving Society.\nAfter collecting some data, Headquarters would like to make a recommendation to all the sites (city offices) on the optimal strategy. Your job is to make that recommendation. Using survey data representative of the whole network, the following ranges have been determined. All ranges represent a 90% confidence interval for data which should be assumed to be normally distributed unless otherwise indicated.\nEach development manager who focuses on corporate development expects to be able to engage between 15 and 25 new corporations a year, and of those engagements they expect 25% of those to succeed. Corporate grants were found to be lognormally distributed and were between $50,000 and $1,000,000 per year. Grants typically extend past the first year of the grant (and when they do they return the same value each year.) The number of years that it will extend is distributed with a Poisson distribution with an expected value of 2 years.\nOn the other hand, development managers who focus on the Giving Society expect to engage between 200 and 500 individuals who could contribute the minimum of $5,000 to enter the Giving Society, with typical success rate of 50%. Giving Society members donate between $5,000 and $50,000, also distributed lognormally, the first year, but on average only 50% of individuals donate the same amount the following year and on average only 10% (of the first year number) donate the same amount in the third year.\nUsing this information, what distribution of corporate to Giving Society development managers should sites use? Is there any additional information that you would need to make this recommendation? Present your recommendation in a format appropriate for a non-technical executive. Please send any scratch work and analysis performed as well.\n","date":1584144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584220809,"objectID":"62971e48b547bcd578f6f78a6f320dcb","permalink":"https://spencerschien.info/post/interview_case_study/data-science-interview-case-study/","publishdate":"2020-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/interview_case_study/data-science-interview-case-study/","section":"post","summary":"First in of three posts on a case study I completed as part of a Data Scientist interview process.","tags":[],"title":"Data Scientist Interview Case Study","type":"post"},{"authors":["Spencer Schien"],"categories":["Interview Case Study"],"content":"Introduction Purpose The purpose of this project is to provide a recommendation for the optimal allocation of development staff at Shocjin Nonprofit sites to either corporation/foundation giving or to Giving Society (GS) giving. Based on the given survey data, it is implied that the numbers represent a stable state (i.e. the number of engagements and rate of success will not diminish with time as the site cycles through the local corporations or other giving populations).\nTo arrive at a recommendation, the following process will be followed:\n Simulate annual giving for both corporations and GS. This will create two dataframes in which each observation represents a gift. Each will also simulate the number of years the gift will be extended. Therefore, each dataframe will represent total commitments from a single year, including those that will be paid in the given year and those that will be anticipated in coming years. Wrap this simulation in a function so it can be used with replicate() to run a Monte Carlo simulation for a given year. Loop the simulation over multiple years to simulate giving trends extending beyond the typical life-cycle of a single year‚Äôs gifts. This method will allow the simulation to reach a stable state, where the additive influence of gifts accumulating and expiring has leveled off. Determine the range of giving that can be expected with 90% confidence during the stable state of giving for both groups. Make the recommendation that allows for an acceptable level of risk while still maintaining an adequate level of giving for each site.  Further Questions and Additional Data This analysis and recommendation is based on distributions and probabilities of survey data, representing a 90% confidence interval. The accuracy of any simulations are therefore limited and would be enhanced with access to the raw data.\nQuestions:\n What impacts the distribution of the number of engagements per year? If it is a function of the size of the city‚Äôs population or economy, then more specific recommendations could be made to sites. Do we observe stable replacement of gifts over the years? This simulation assumes that the answer is yes ‚Äì meaning there is not a point where the giving supply is ‚Äútapped out‚Äù, so to speak. What other forms of return does a Shocjin Nonprofit site receive from engagements with corporations or individuals through the Giving Society? This analysis is based solely on the financial return in terms of giving, but returns in the form of enhanced recruitment, partnerships that might reduce or distribute costs, etc. could be considered as well.  Modeling 1. Simulating the Data First, we need to recreate a single year of giving for both corporate and GS giving. The code below simulates the appropriate number of engagements, the success rate of engagements, the distribution of gift sizes, and the distribution of gift extensions.\nlibrary(EnvStats) # for truncated distributions library(tidyverse) # for data manipulation and visualization library(scales) # for setting percentages and scales, specifically in visuals library(ggbeeswarm) # for creating the violin-like dot plot library(ggalt) # for dumbbell plot # set seed to ensure reproducibility set.seed(123) # Randomly assign the number of new corporations engaged in the year # based on a truncated normal distribution; sd is estimated to ensure full # range shows up in the samples.

This is because corporate giving is much more volatile, with a larger range of gift sizes and a smaller number of gifts received each year.\nThe Recommendation The optimal distribution of development staff is to maximize focus on Giving Society giving, especially in startup years (i.e. first years of implementation for both types of giving).\nThe level to which it is maximized should be determined by the non-monetary value of the corporate engagements.\nCaveats The simulations upon which this recommendation is based assume that there are no diminishing returns, either over time (i.e. supply doesn‚Äôt dwindle as the site cycles through new individuals and corporations every year) or in a single year (i.e. a second development manager would experience the same number of engagements and rate of success).\nIf these assumptions do not remain true, the accuracy of this model will falter. The distribution of gift sizes and number of gifts should therefore be monitored on an ongoing basis so the model and recommendation can be adjusted if necessary.\nAlso, as mentioned above, we assume there are non-monetary returns for both types of engagement. Quantifying these returns and gathering data on these values should be done in the future to enhance the model and recommendations.\n","date":1584144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584226440,"objectID":"047349c6cd80cc8a0f28780db5bb96be","permalink":"https://spencerschien.info/post/interview_case_study/recommendation/","publishdate":"2020-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/interview_case_study/recommendation/","section":"post","summary":"Third of three posts on a case study I completed as part of a Data Scientist interview process.","tags":[],"title":"Recommendation to Leadership","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let‚Äôs make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
